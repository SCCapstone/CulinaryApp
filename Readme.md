# I am Chef - Cullinary App

I am chef is a  chef-inspired and chef-driven app meant to improve and inspire personal wellness by providing a wealth of healthy and delicious recipes right to the users fingertips. The app tailers specific recipe/food options to each individual user based on user profile data. This can include things like health conditions, allergies, lifestyle, activity/fitness levels, or any specific caloric goals the user is aiming to reach. We also hope to achieve a social media-like environment later down the line which can promote healthy eating habits by connecting individual users with each other as well as with actual chefs. This will include things like photo sharing and personalized recommendations from chefs on the platform.
