# I am Chef - Cullinary App

I am chef is a  chef-inspired and chef-driven app meant to improve and inspire personal wellness by providing a wealth of healthy and delicious recipes right to the users fingertips. The app tailers specific recipe/food options to each individual user based on user profile data. This can include things like health conditions, allergies, lifestyle, activity/fitness levels, or any specific caloric goals the user is aiming to reach. We also hope to achieve a social media-like environment later down the line which can promote healthy eating habits by connecting individual users with each other as well as with actual chefs. This will include things like photo sharing and personalized recommendations from chefs on the platform.

To maintain consistency and to help spot errors quicker, we'll be using the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) for our project.

## External Requirements
Download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

## Setup
Clone the repo, then import it into Android Studio as a project. For now, run the project on an emulator. To do so, you will need to create an Android Virtual Device, information on creating one can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds#createavd).  

## Running
In the AndroidStudio toolbar, select the emluator you created or physical device you're using,  press the run or debug button.

## Deployment
Use Android Studio menus (Build->Build Bundle/APK) to build an App Bundle or an APK. App Bundle is preferred for current versions of Android Studio. Follow instructions provided. Signing is included within the dialogs. Uploading on Google Drive requires an existing developer's account/license, but all instructions are provided at https://play.google.com/console/about/

## Testing
All test files are located in [CullinaryApp/app/src/test/java/com/github/CullinaryApp/](https://github.com/SCCapstone/CulinaryApp/tree/main/app/src/test/java/com/github/CulinaryApp)

To run a test one can either:

1. Open the project in android studio and in the terminal type ``` .\gradlew test ```
2. Open the project in android studio. Navigate to the test folder and open the desired test. Either run the whole test by clicking the green arrow icon next to the public class method, or run a specific test by clicking the green arrow next to the specific public void method (located underneath an "@Test" line).

Tests are located in /app/src/androidTest/java/com/github/CulinaryApp and /app/src/test/java/com/github/CulinaryApp
