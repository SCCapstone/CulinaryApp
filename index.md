## How to Use
I am Chef is designed to be simple and intuitive. Here's how it works

### Registration:
###### Users
To register a general user account, being by clicking on the "Not a member? Get registered in Firebase now!" button in the lower part of your screen. From there simply enter your email, password, and don't forget to confirm your password. After hitting next you'll just have to enter a few more details. Enter your first and last name along with clicking on any lifestyle preferences that match you! Upload a profile picture and a background image and you're all set to go!

###### Chefs
If you're a chef wanting to register an account you'll also have to click the "Not a member? Get registered in Firebase now!" button in the lower part of your screen. Then click the "Chef Registration!" text right under the page header. From there we just need your email, password (don't forget the confirmation!), first and last name, and what organization you're affiliated with. Then just hit "Register" and you're all set!

### Signing In and Out:
###### Signing in:   
Once you have finished registering, and the app has indicated that you are finished with the process, you're all done! The app will return you to the login page and simply enter your email and password as usual, no email verification required!

###### Signing out:   
If you're already logged in and would like to log out, look to the bottom navigation bar and tap "Logout". A confirmation box will appear, tap "yes" to confirm that you would like to log out. At that point, you will return to the login page and will not be able to access the contents of the app until you log in again 

### Viewing your suggestions:
----------------------------explain the home page, what appears and in what order (so they know what the point of scrolling down is), make sure to explain searching, and that you can click on whole category names as well as individual recipes

### Modifying your suggestions:
-----------------------------explain the ways you can filter out recipes, go in depth on the various options for diets, and where to find the settings to change them

### Saving and sharing recipes you like:
Once you've found a recipe you love, you'll want to share it or save it for later. Here's how to do that

###### Saving a recipe:
Saving allows you to keep a list of your favorite recipes and quickly access them without searching

To save a recipe, find the recipe's page and simply tap the heart button under the name of the recipe. Once it has turned red, it means your like has been recorded in the app, and you have saved the recipe  
Saved recipes can be found on the 'favorites' page, just tap the 'favorites' button in the bottom bar and you'll see a list of all your likes. Each item in the list is a permanent link to that recipe, so there's no more need to go searching for the recipe!
To remove a like, repeat the like action, and the red heart on the recipe will return to its original gray, showing that the recipe is no longer in your likes.

###### Sharing a recipe:
Sharing helps you spread the word about recipes you love. Sharing a recipe will send the recipe's name, ingredients, and instructions as text to any messaging app

To share a recipe, find the recipe's page and tap the share icon under the name of the recipe. This will initiate the share menu. Scroll through the menu until you find the app which you wish to share to, and tap that app's icon  


### Editing your Profile:
---------(Lukacs)--------------------explain the profile page, what can be changed, don't go into depth about preferences as it has already been explained, reference the explanation instead
