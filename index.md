## What it Does
*I am Chef* is the exciting new recipe discovery application for Android

Make an account and receive access to an entire database of unique recipes  
Categorize by region or type of food, filter out foods you don't want to see, or just scroll through the home page until you find your perfect match  
Vegetarian? *Vegan?* Even *Flexitarian??* *I am Chef* shows you only what you want, but if you aren't sure yet, just try the various options and find something you'll love!

## How to Use
I am Chef is designed to be simple and intuitive. Here's how it works

### Registration:
------------------------explain the things you do/set and why you do/set them

### Signing In and Out:
##### Signing in:   
Once you have finished registering, and the app has indicated that you are finished with the process, you're all done! The app will return you to the login page and simply enter your email and password as usual, no email verification required!

##### Signing out:   
If you're already logged in and would like to log out, look to the bottom navigation bar and tap "Logout". A confirmation box will appear, tap "yes" to confirm that you would like to log out. At that point, you will return to the login page and will not be able to access the contents of the app until you log in again 

### Viewing your suggestions:
----------------------------explain the home page, what appears and in what order (so they know what the point of scrolling down is), make sure to explain searching, and that you can click on whole category names as well as individual recipes

### Modifying your suggestions:
-----------------------------explain the ways you can filter out recipes, go in depth on the various options for diets, and where to find the settings to change them

### Saving and sharing recipes you like:
---------(Lukacs)----------------------------explain the recipesinstructions page and the favorites page, go in depth on what is shared when you press share and which apps that can send to, how to like a recipe and where to find the likes, how to unlike a recipe, that recipes are linked to from the favorites page

### Editing your Profile:
---------(Lukacs)--------------------explain the profile page, what can be changed, don't go into depth about preferences as it has already been explained, reference the explanation instead


## Images
-------------------------------Either a section with images or we distribute the images into the other sections
